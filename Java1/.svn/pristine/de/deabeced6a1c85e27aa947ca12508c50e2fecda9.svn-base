/* 2. Create a child class of your PlayingCard class that can be used in the Set game 
   (Links to an external site.). You will need to do a little research on the cards 
    that are present in a Set game deck. Your child class should have at least the 
    following:
    
		•	Fields: shape, color, backgroundFill
		•	Constructors: a parameterized constructor (no default constructor allowed)
		•	Getters and setters for each field
		•	An appropriate toString() method

The deck consists of 81 cards varying in four features: number (one, two, or three); 
symbol (diamond, squiggle, oval); shading (solid, striped, or open); and color 
(red, green, or purple).[1] Each possible combination of features 
(e.g., a card with three striped green diamonds) appears precisely once in the deck.
