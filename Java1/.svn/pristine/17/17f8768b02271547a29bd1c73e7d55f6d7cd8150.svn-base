// Create an abstract class, called "CardGame", that stores fields and methods that are shared among most card games. The class should include:
//
// Fields:
// name: the name of the game
// welcomeMessage: a message that introduces the game
// A single parameterized constructor that assigns your fields.
// Three abstract methods
// public abstract void shuffle()
// This method will shuffle the deck of cards being used in the game
// You will need to use the Random class to generate random integers here
// public abstract Card deal()
// Deals a single card from the deck to the user (notice the return type)
// public abstract void playRound()
// Plays a single hand in the game
// With Blackjack this is a single match between the player and dealer
// Create a child class of the "CardGame" class called "BlackjackGame."
