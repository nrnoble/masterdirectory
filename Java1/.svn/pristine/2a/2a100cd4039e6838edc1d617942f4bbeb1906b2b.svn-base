// Create an abstract class, called "CardGame", that stores fields and methods that are shared among most card games. The class should include:
//
// Fields:
// name: the name of the game
// welcomeMessage: a message that introduces the game
// A single parameterized constructor that assigns your fields.
// Three abstract methods
// public abstract void shuffle()
// This method will shuffle the deck of cards being used in the game
